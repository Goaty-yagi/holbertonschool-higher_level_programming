## Conventional Commits
This project follows the conventional commits specification for commit messages.
You can find more details from [Conventional Commits](https://github.com/Goaty-yagi/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md).

## Code Formatting and Style
This project follows the Pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8) code style guidelines to maintain consistent and readable code. Pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
