# Python - import & modules

This project includes a comprehensive practice to understanding and harnessing the power of Python's import system and modules.

## Learning Objectives

This project is based on the learning objectives - see the [LEARNING_OBJECTIVES](https://github.com/Goaty-yagi/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/LEANING_OBJECTIVES.md) file for details.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Practice Exercises

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

**File:** `0-add.py`
**Description:** Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
**Requirement:** 
- You have to use print function with string format to display integers
- You have to assign:
-- the value 1 to a variable called a
-- the value 2 to a variable called b
-- and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
- a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
- Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
- You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below


### 1. My first toolbox!

**File:** `1-calculation.py`
**Description:** Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
**Requirement:** 
- Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
- You have to define:
-- the value 10 to a variable a
-- the value 5 to a variable b
-- and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
- a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
- Your program should call each of the imported functions.
- the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported
